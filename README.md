# UltronResearchCollaborator
# Ultron: Voice-Driven Hypothesis Generator

## Project Concept
Ultron is an AI-powered research assistant designed to facilitate **voice-driven scientific hypothesis generation and validation**. The system allows researchers to brainstorm aloud, refine hypotheses through interactive discussions, and validate ideas against real-world scientific literature.

## Core Capabilities
- **Real-Time Speech Processing**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper API for transcribing voice input into structured text.
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Extracts potential research hypotheses from user discussions using an AI model.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Engages in follow-up questioning to refine hypotheses.
- **Validation Against Scientific Literature**: Queries sources like **arXiv, PubMed, Wikipedia, and Semantic Scholar** to check credibility and provide supporting or contradictory evidence.
- **Voice Feedback**: Uses OpenAI's text-to-speech (TTS) to provide spoken responses, making the experience fully conversational.

## Intended Use Case
Ultron is ideal for **researchers, scientists, and students** looking to explore new ideas, validate concepts, and engage in a dynamic, AI-assisted scientific discussion.
